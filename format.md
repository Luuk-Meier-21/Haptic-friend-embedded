## Function declaration
C++ standard:
```
Function() 
{

}
```
Personal preference:
```
Function() {

}
```

## Spacing

```
Function() {
    int intDelaration;
    char charDelaration

    expression() {

    }
}
```
Keep one space betweet declarations and expressions. Grouping them is perferred as well.
